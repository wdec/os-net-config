# ovs_user_bridge type refers to the OVSUserBridge OVS ifup type, which will
# have the datapath type set as 'netdev' for DPDK processing.
# ovs_dpdk_port type refers to the OVSDPDKPort OVS ifup type, which will
# add the port to the bridge with the interface type as 'dpdk'.
# ovs_dpdk_bond type refers to the OVSDPDKBond OVS ifup type, which will
